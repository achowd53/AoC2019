# AoC2019
Advent Of Code 2019 Problems In Python
This is just the code I've used to solve the AoC problems in 2019
The first few days of code are incomplete in terms of giving both solutions and will probably only give one solution 
Otherwise in the days to come, code will output both solutions given an input file
